        <h1 style="color:purple;" class="center-text">My Extracurriculars</h1>
        <p class="center-text">About me:</p>
        <p class="center-text">My name is Adam Benelcadi, I am 18 years old, and I am from Morocco. I earned my Baccalaureate in Mathematical Sciences with honors "mention très bien", and I am currently a first-year student at the National School of Applied Sciences. Throughout all of my high school years, I was ranked first in mathematics, which further fueled my passion for problem-solving and innovation.</p>
        <p class="center-text">I am actively involved in my community, being a member of two associations. The first is focused on youths and development, where we work on initiatives that empower young people, and the second is a charity organization, where we work to support those in need and give back to the community.</p>
        <p class="center-text">I have a strong interest in computer science and have completed an online certification from Harvard University in Computer Science. Additionally, I’ve taken a course on Introduction to Leadership Fundamentals, which has helped me develop my leadership skills and equipped me to work effectively in teams.</p>
        <p class="center-text">I did an internship at Subul Assalam, the Center for Arabic Language, where I gained valuable experience. As for my sports interests, I engage in freediving, swimming, bodybuilding, and drawing as a creative outlet.</p>
        <p class="center-text">Currently, I am participating in the NASA Space Apps Challenge, where I am collaborating virtually with a global team. Together, we are working on a project that supports the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our idea is to build a website that can be integrated into the curriculum, allowing students to discover the SDGs in a way that mixes learning and playing at the same time, using technology to address some of the world’s most pressing challenges.</p>
        <p class="center-text">Hoping to change the world through computer science, I look forward to continuing my academic and professional growth, contributing to impactful projects that make a difference in both my community and globally.</p>
